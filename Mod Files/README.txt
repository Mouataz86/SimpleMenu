** Introduction **

* These are the main files for end-user product *

These are the mod only files but in order for the mod to work you must have:

- LemonUI.SHVDN3
- Newtonsoft.Json

Which you can install them from their official source:

LemonUI.SHVDN3: https://github.com/LemonUIbyLemon/LemonUI/releases
Newtonsoft.Json: https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json

I have already placed these files inside the " Resources ".

**SM DATA FOLDER **

This folder contains the vehicles.json file, this file is required for " Spawn Cars " option. Without this file
You can't spawn cars using the menu and you'll receive a warning about the missing file... Directly if the SM Data
folder was not found the mod will create it directly and you have to place the vehicles.json inside it.
